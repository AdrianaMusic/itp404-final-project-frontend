# Coffe Now

Coffee Now is a web app targeting the ultra lazy: those who aren't willing to go to the closest coffee shop for coffee.  They could use a delivery service like Postmates, but there are just too many options!  Thankfully, Coffee Now is here.  With only 4 options on your screen sorted by delivery time, you can order in very few steps.  No need for options when it just gets a cup of black coffee to you as fast as possible. To order the coffee, I will be using the Postmates API to track and and send out the delivery.  For payments, I will be using the Stripe API.  The project will focus heavily on the UX and UI of ordering coffee ASAP.
